Introduction:**

   A comprehensive analysis of financial transactions in a fictional bank to understand customer behavior, 
   account balances, and potential fraud, as well as to generate insights into financial trends and 
   customer segmentation.

  **Code:** (https://github.com/prashantofficial05/Financial-Transactions-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
  
  **Goal:**
  
   To evaluate and analyze customer transactions, identify spending patterns, monitor account 
   activities, and detect anomalies, offering insights to support financial decision-making and improve 
   customer segmentation.

**Description:**
   - **Define Scope:** Focus on the bankâ€™s customer transactions and account activity to analyze financial 
        behavior.
   - **Data Collection:** Sample datasets are created to simulate customer profiles, account details, and 
       transaction histories.
   - **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer behavior, account balances, and 
       transaction frequency.
   - **Fraud Detection:** Identify anomalies in transactions that may suggest fraud, such as unusually large 
       withdrawals.
   - **Customer Segmentation:** Analyze customer transaction patterns to identify high-value customers and 
       those with frequent activity.
     
**Skills:**
   - SQL for database creation, data manipulation, and advanced querying.
   - Data Analysis techniques including aggregations, window functions, and fraud detection.
   - Python for data cleaning, additional analysis, and visualization.
   - Data visualization using Tableau or Matplotlib for reporting key findings.
     
**Metrics:**
   - Total account balances.
   - Total deposits and withdrawals per customer.
   - Transaction frequency by customer.
   - Fraud detection (based on transaction anomalies).
   - High-value customer segmentation.


**Summary:**
    Provides insights into customer account balances, transaction behavior, potential fraud detection, and 
    customer segmentation. Helps financial institutions better understand customer behavior and support 
    decision-making.

**Next Steps:**
   - Enhance fraud detection using machine learning techniques.
   - Expand customer segmentation analysis by including more demographic data.
   - Integrate external data sources (economic indicators) to correlate transaction trends with external 
     factors.
